## Instructions

* This is a RPG (role-playing-game) where the user chooses from among 4 predetermined Star Wars themed characters and then
battles the remaining 3 to the death.

* The game will generate a random set of hit points (hp), attack and counterattack power damage amounts.

* The user will then pick a character to play and that player will move to the player area.

* The user will subsequently choose a first enemy to battle who will then move to the enemy area.

* The user will then precede to attack via the button until either the player or enemy perishes.

* If the player is killed the game reloads 

* If the first enemy is killed the user then selects another enemy to battle who then moves to the enemy area

* If all enemies are killed the user wins and the game resets.

* Have fun! This game can also be found in my portfolio @ <https://ocskier.github.io/Bootstrap-Portfolio/portfolio.html>
